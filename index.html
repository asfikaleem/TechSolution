               Teens who spend more time than average on screen activities are more likely to be unhappy, and those who spend more time than average on non-screen activities are more likely to be happy. There’s not a single exception. If you were going to give advice for a happy adolescence based on this [national] survey, it would be straightforward: <em>Put down the phone, turn off the laptop, and do something—anything—that does not involve a screen.</em>

               Schools nationwide have rushed to supply their classrooms with computers, and many policy makers say it is foolish to do otherwise. But the contrarian point of view can be found at the epicenter of the tech economy, where some parents and educators have a message: computers and schools don’t mix.

          <ul><li>A fundamental tenet of Tech education is that the loving guidance of a class teacher, whom children know and trust, helps them to grow into self-confident learners and adults. We are very proud of the fact that the Tech Solution Institute of Oshawa is a place where every child is seen, known, and loved.</li>
          <li> Tech class teachers are authorities on their subject matter, as well as storytellers, musicians, artists, and actors. They teach the first one-hour lesson block of the day covering primarily Olympiad, Reasoning, Mental math, and Physical activity. The class teacher is also responsible for students’ overall academic and social development. Subject specialists in world languages, math, reading, English, music, movement, handwork, woodwork, and athletics teach students throughout the grades. </li>
        <li><b>All Tech teachers are highly trained, credentialed, and experienced.</b> Class teachers in each grade hold both a college degree and teacher certification from one of several recognized teacher training colleges or institutes.</li>

          <ul><li>During the elementary years, a student’s imagination and feelings serve as the gateway to deep, sustained learning and intellectual growth. Tech teachers present academic material artistically through drama, story, art, music, and movement. This interdisciplinary approach engenders a deep love of learning and challenges students on multiple levels. </li>
          <li> Expectations and student accountability increase in the middle school years. Teachers strive to ensure students are well-prepared for the rigors of high school. Fourth and fifth grade students receive additional classes in mathematics and Science skills; they are challenged to manage long-term and independent projects; and they deepen their understanding of important concepts. </li>
         <br>
          <b>Main Lesson</b>
          <li>At the heart of the Tech Solution curriculum is the “Main Lesson”, a one-hour period of concentrated inquiry that begins each school day, when students are freshest and ready for sustained effort. In Main Lesson, we study one of four central subjects for a “block” of three to four weeks, inviting in-depth exploration and learning. Our four central subjects are:</li>
          <li><u>Physical activity</u></li>
          <li><u>Olympiad</u></li>
          <li><u>Mental Math</u></li>
          <li><u>Reasoning</u></li>
          </ul>

          <br>
          <b>Class Teacher</b>
          <li>Every morning, as each child crosses the threshold for Main Lesson, he or she is welcomed by the Class Teacher with a handshake. Ideally, this individual leads the students from first through fifth grades, for five years of handshakes and Main Lessons. The Class Teacher serves as an important role model for students, nurturing everyone’s potential in the context of a strong relationship. Because social learning is central to Tech Solution education, the class teacher acts as a guide for the class, fostering cooperation and mutual respect.</li>

                      Technology can be a wonderful tool. However, the promise of technology in education has fallen far short of its aims—while study after study warns of the harm technology and media use pose for children, particularly during the early years of critical brain development.<br><br>
                      At the Tech Solution of Oshawa, our classrooms are screen-free, and our students thrive, both academically and socially. Our “unplugged” approach is backed not only by current research, but by the hundreds of thoughtful, creative, successful students who have graduated from the Tech Solution Institution of Oshawa.
